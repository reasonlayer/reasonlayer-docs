## Get started

### Step 1: Create a bot with BotFather

Go to Telegram, start a new chat with **@BotFather**, and send a message that says `/newbot`. Pick a name and a username. Keep in mind the **username** has to end in "bot" or "_bot".

### Step 2: Get your token

BotFather will give you a token as shown above. The token in this case is `8266461190:AAGMqDbj0MzvvjIE_Ulr6k6w5__WSSg6Pw0`. Do **NOT** share this with anyone, or else they can use your bot.

### Step 3: Paste token and complete pairing

Paste this token into our interface and your bot on Telegram will give you a pairing code. To complete the pairing, use the **terminal** tab in the Reasonlayer dashboard and run:

```
openclaw gateway
openclaw pairing list telegram
openclaw pairing approve telegram <CODE>
```

Replace `<CODE>` with the pairing code from your Telegram bot.

### Step 4: You're done!
