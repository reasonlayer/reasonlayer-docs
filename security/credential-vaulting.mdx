Reasonlayer provides built-in credential vaulting so you can keep credentials away from your agents. Tokens are injected at execution time through our security layer, ensuring your API keys and secrets never live in agent code or configuration.

## How it works

Credentials are stored securely in the Reasonlayer vault and are only made available to your agent when it runs. The agent receives tokens through environment variables or secure injection—never hardcoded or exposed in logs.

## Adding credentials

Create credentials in your Reasonlayer dashboard and specify which domains each credential can access. For example, an OpenRouter API key should have allowed domains set to `*.openrouter.ai`.

See [Adding an API Key](/essentials/api-key) for step-by-step instructions on configuring your first credential.
