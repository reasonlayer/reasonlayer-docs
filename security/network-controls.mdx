Reasonlayer lets you define allow and block lists to control what websites your agent has access to. This prevents agents from reaching unintended or malicious destinations.

## How it works

Configure network controls in your Reasonlayer dashboard to specify which domains your agent can connect to. You can use allow lists to restrict access to only approved services, or block lists to exclude specific sites.

## Credential-level controls

When adding credentials, you specify allowed domains for each credential. This ensures that even if an agent has a credential, it can only use it when making requests to the domains you've approved.
