You can install the ReasonLayer security layer on OpenClaws you host yourself—on any cloud provider or even locally on your laptop, Mac mini, or other devices.

This gives you our security features—credential vaulting, network controls, and auditing—without migrating to our managed hosting.

## There are slightly different steps for installing OpenClaw on different setups
