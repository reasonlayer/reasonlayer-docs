Credentials you add to the Reasonlayer vault are injected as environment variables when your Openclaw runs. You can treat them exactly like regular environment variables—use them in skills or tell your Openclaw about them in chat.

## In skills

Reference the credential by its environment variable name in your skill instructions. For example:

````markdown
---
name: call-openrouter-api
description: Call the OpenRouter API for LLM completions. Use when the user needs to generate text or get AI responses.

# OpenRouter API Skill

Use the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` environment variable when making requests to OpenRouter. The key is already available—no need to pass it manually.

Example request:
```bash
curl https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENROUTER_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model": "openai/gpt-4", "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}]}'
```
````

The credential name you set in the Reasonlayer dashboard (e.g. `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`) is the same name your agent sees at runtime.

## In chat

You can also tell your Openclaw about credentials directly in chat. Refer to them as environment variables:

> "Use the `STRIPE_API_KEY` environment variable when making Stripe API calls."

> "The `DATABASE_URL` env var has the connection string—use it for database queries."

Your Openclaw will use the injected value when it runs, without you exposing the actual secret.
