As an example, we're going to add an OPENROUTER_API_KEY to the vault to show you how it works.

## Steps

1. **Get your API Key from the provider** - in this case I went to Openrouter and generated a key.

2. **Create a credential in Reasonlayer** — In your Reasonlayer dashboard, create a new credential named whatever you want:

   - **Name:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - **Allowed domains:** `*.openrouter.ai`

{" "}
<Note>
  We also added a button to add Openrouter's config easily because it's a common
  API key to add when setting up agents. Openrouter lets you use many agent
  models using one API key, [visit their site here](https://openrouter.ai).
</Note>

We allow wildcards in the allowed domains field (e.g., `*.openrouter.ai` matches all subdomains of openrouter.ai).

4. After adding all of your credentials, click apply changes. This will run a restart on the machine if you're hosting your openclaw on Reasonlayer.
5. The environment your agent runs in can now make requests using OPENROUTER_API_KEY but won't know it's value. The agent sees the environment variable as `rlcredXXXXX` but in reality we replace it in our security layer with the actual value before making the request.
