To use AI models with your agent, you need to add an OpenRouter API key as a credential. OpenRouter is used because it lets you select whatever model you like.

## Steps

1. **Sign up at OpenRouter** — Go to [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) and create an account.

2. **Get your API key** — After signing up, generate an API key from your OpenRouter dashboard.

3. **Create a credential in Reasonlayer** — In your Reasonlayer dashboard, create a new credential with:
   - **Name:** `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` (must be named exactly this)
   - **Allowed domains:** `*.openrouter.ai`

Your agent will now have access to AI models through OpenRouter.

## Editing the model

The default model is Opus from Anthropic. To change it, go to the **Code** tab in Reasonlayer, open the `openclaw.json` file in the file system, and edit it there.
