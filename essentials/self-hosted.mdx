Want to run your agent on your own infrastructure? We support self-install deployments on your own machine or VM — while still connecting to Reasonlayer's secure platform.

<Note>
  Self-install is coming soon. Contact [ariel@reasonlayer.com](mailto:ariel@reasonlayer.com) to get access immediately.
</Note>

## Why self-install?

- **Your own infrastructure** — Run agents on your own machine, server, or VM.
- **Same security** — Still connects to Reasonlayer's platform with all the same security features (credential vaulting, network controls, audit logging).
- **Custom environments** — Install any dependencies or tools you need on your hardware.
