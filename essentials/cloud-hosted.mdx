Let Reasonlayer handle the infrastructure. Deploy your agent in minutes with our managed cloud platform.

## How it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your OpenRouter API key">
    Your agent needs access to AI models. Add your OpenRouter API key as a credential so your agent can think.
    
    See [Adding an API Key](/essentials/api-key) for full instructions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add your credentials">
    Add any credentials your agent needs (API keys, tokens, etc.) in the **Credentials** tab. These are securely vaulted and injected at runtime — your agent never sees the raw values.
    
    After adding credentials, click **Apply** to make them available to your agent.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add skills and customize">
    Use the **Code** tab to access your agent's file system. From here you can:
    
    - Add new skill files to extend your agent's capabilities
    - Edit configuration files like `openclaw.json`
    - Or just tell your agent to create skills for you — it can edit its own files
    
    <Tip>
      When adding skills that need tokens or API keys, don't hardcode them in the skill files. Instead, add the token in the **Credentials** tab as if it were an environment variable. It will automatically be available to your agent at runtime.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pricing

Each deployed agent costs **$10/month**. This includes:

- Managed hosting infrastructure
- Credential vaulting
- Network controls
- Audit logging
- All security features

<Note>
  This is less than what cloud providers charge us to host your machine — you get our security features for free.
