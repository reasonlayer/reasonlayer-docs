<Steps>
  <Step title="Deploy your agent">
    Add an OpenClaw agent in Reasonlayer to get started. Each deployed agent costs $10/month.

    <Note>
      This is less than what cloud providers charge us to host your machine and you get our security features for free.
    </Note>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add an API key">
    Configure your AI model by adding an OpenRouter API key. See [Adding an API Key](/essentials/api-key) for full instructions.

    In short: sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai), get your API key, then create a credential named `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with allowed domains `*.openrouter.ai`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Connect to chat apps">
    Access your agent via Slack, Telegram, and other chat platforms. See [Connecting to Chat Apps](/essentials/channels) for setup instructions.
